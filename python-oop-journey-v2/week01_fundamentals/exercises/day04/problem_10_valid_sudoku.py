"""Problem 10: Valid Sudoku

Topic: Hash Set, Validation
Difficulty: Medium

Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid.

Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:
1. Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
2. Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
3. Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

Note:
- A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
- Only the filled cells need to be validated.
- Empty cells are represented by '.'
